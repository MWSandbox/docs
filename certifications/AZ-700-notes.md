  - In Windows Admin center, there is an extension for extended networks
  - After tunnel has been established, IP addresses need to be defined that shall be extended into Azure
- Point-2-Site VPN:
  - Individuals connecting to Azure
  - A root certificate needs to be created, each client needs a certificate to connect, signed by the root cert
  - Configuration:
    - Address pool assigned to clients dynamically

    1. Enable BFD on the interface
    2. Link it to the BGP session

# Security
- Firewall vs WAF on Application Gateway:
  - WAF only filters incoming HTTPS traffic, handles Cross Site Scripting, etc.
  - Firewall also outgoing and non HTTPS traffic, more logic
  - Route table needs to be configured to route traffic through the firewall subnet - can also be setup the same way for App gateway
  - if both are configured: route inbound traffic through app gateway subnet and outbound traffic through firewall subnet
  - Azure Firewall requires its own dedicated subnet

## Azure Firewall
- Microsoft Threat Intelligence: Knows malicious IPs and FQDNs
- Needs to be placed in its own subnet which needs to be called "AzureFirewallSubnet"
- Tiers:
  - Basic (very low bandwidth, no content filtering)
  - Standard
  - Premium: 
    - TLS inspection (TLS termination / 2 separate TLS connections from source to target)
    - URL filtering
    - IDPS (intrusion detection and prevention system, check byte sequencey in network traffic, etc.)
    - Web categories: Categorizes URLS using the complete URL not only FQDN (standard) - e.g.: google.com/news -> News
- Firewall management:
  - via firewall policies
    - Policiy config:
      - Can be added via collections or single rules
      - Priorities will be used
      - Allow/Deny
      - Define Source and Destination (IP/FQDN) as well as ports
      - Rule groups to collect rules / rule collections
    - Types:
      - Parent policy: Inheritance of rules
      - Rule collections: Set of rules with same priorities and action
      - DNAT rules: TCP/UDP protocols + ports + translated address and port
        - E.g. use public ip of firewall and RDP port -> forward it to private VM + RDP port
      - Network rules: TCP/UDP/ICMP/Any + ports
        - Can be used to Allow DNS lookup (UDP port 53) and add IP addresses of DNS servers, filter base on IP, ports
      - Application rules: http/https/etc. protocols + ports
        - Filter based on FQDNs, URLs, etc.
  - via firewall rules (classic)
- Requires public IP
- Can act as a DNS proxy (e.g. to forward DNS requests to Azure internal DNS)
- Traffic needs to be routed through the firewall network (use private IP address of firewall)
- Forced tunneling can be enabled when VPN tunneling is used
- Firewall manager:
  - Allows management of firewall policies across network
  - Types of networks that can be secured that way: Virtual WAN, Hub + Spoke
  - Detect VNets / WAN that do not have firewall attached to it
  - Policies can be associated with other networks / hubs
## WAF
- Core rule set which protects against OWASP (supports different versions)
- Integrations to application gateway, front door, CDN
- WAF global policy with managed rules for OWASP
- Custom rules can be added and can override default rules:
  - Priority
  - Match Type (e.g. string)
  - Match Variable (e.g. RequestUri)
  - Operation (is / is not)
  - Operator (e.g. contains)
  - Transformations
  - Match Values
  - Action (Allow / deny)
## NSGs
- Default rules cannot be altered: 
  - Inbound: Allow within Vnet traffic, load balancer traffic and deny everything else
  - Outound: Allow towards Vnet, Internet, deny anything else (other private IPs)
- Can be attached to NICs or subnets
- Applications (https, etc.) and protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP) configurable
- Source / targets: IPs / Service Tags / Application Security Group
- Service Tags: Internet, etc. -> A group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service
- Application security group: Group together resources with the samen security / network requirements

# Service endpoints
- Need to be setup on the subnet side and on the service side that should be connected (add exception in network settings for subnet that should be conencted)
- Better performance and latency compared to public / Azure managed network
- Increased security
- Service does not need to be in the same region and subscription as the subnet (except SQL Database)

# DNS
- Azure DNS Private Resolver
  - Azure private DNS records can be used OnPrem
  - Provides DNS services between On-Prem and Azure
  - Conditional forwarding via rules -> e.g. if internet needs to be resolved, the Azure DNS Private Resolver can forward those requests to an internet DNS server
  - Inbound (from on prem to azure)/output (from azure to on prem) endpoints, latter will be forwarded to onprem DNS
- Public DNS zone
  - You can register any domain name -> Multiple Name servers of azure will be displayed
  - Azure name servers need to be configured in a domain name registrar
- Records:
  - A = Point to IPv4 address
  - CNAME = Link subdomain to another record
  - NS = Authorative name server for that domain
  - SOA = Start of Authority - stores metadata like the email address of the admin
  - Use @ sign in DNS record to refer to the standard domain name without subdomain
- Private DNS Zone:
  - No NS record
  - Needs to be linked to VNETs
  - Auto registration can be enabled -> All VMs will automatically receive a nicename
    - Static IP address changes need to be manually changed in DNS entrys as well
- DNS settings can be configured for VNet (default = Azure, but custom servers possible)
  - Azure DNS private Zones
  - Azure-provided name resolution
  - Custom DNS server
  - Azure DNS Private Resolver
- NIC settings can override VNet settings

# Connecting VNETs
- VNET peering
  - Types:
    - Standard: Within the same region
    - Global: Across Azure regions
  - Traffic over Microsoft backbone network, not public internet
  - Pricing for outbount and inbound traffic even for standard VNET peering (charged twice)
  - IP ranges should not be overlapping
  - Configuration:
    - Block traffic from one direction to the other
    - Allow forwarding of traffic from one direction to the other (VNet in between)
    - Gateway transit: Use the Virtual Network Gateway of another VNet and route server
  - Sensitive data should be encrypted -> Use network gateway
  - In a globally peered Vnet, resources in one Vnet can communicate/interact with the front-end IP addresses of a Basic internal load balancer.
  - Service chaining:
    - Direct traffic to a resource in another VNet via user-defined routes (next hop IP address in different VNet - e.g. Gateway)
    - Cannot be used when there is a user-defined route that specifies ER gateway as next hop type
  - VPN peering is non-transitive: To make it transitive a VNET Gateway needs to be used

# WAN
- Hub & Spoke:
  - All network connect to one hub, instead of connecting all networks to each other
- Virtual WAN:
  - Types:
    - Basic: Only VPN S2S
    - Standard: ExpressrRoute, all VPN options, VNET-to-VNET, etc.
  - Pricing:
    - Per hour, per GB of use, bandwidth dependent, per connection
    - Scale units: Throughput of gateways in WAN (1 - 200)
      - S2S: 1 SU = 500 Mbps
      - P2S: 1 SU = 500 Mbps, supports 500 clients
      - ER: 1 SU = 2 Gbps
  - Hub:
    - Has its own network private address space
    - Can create gateways for VPN S2S/P2S and ExpressRoute
    - Options for traffic to tracel accross Microsoft network as long as possible before it enters public internet
  - VPN Sites:
    - Similar to local network gateway for the Virtual WAN
    - Links can be added for the actual VPN Gateway OnPrem: IP address, BPG address, ASN number, Link speed etc. need to be entered
    - After creating the link, the site needs to be connected:
      - Pre-shared key can be entered, protocol and routing options can be selected
  - Virtual network connections:
    - VNETs can be selected and route table assigned
  - Transit VNet connectivity can be established by connecting a NVA in a connected VNet and peer VNets with this Vnet
    - Add custom routes to the outer VNets to point to the NVA
    - Routes will be synced automatically through BGP peering from Virtual WAN router

# Routing
- System routes: Default set of routes
  - Routing within the VNET
  - 0.0.0.0/0 -> Internet
- VNet peering, Virtual network gateway, Service Endpoints -> Will add routes to the system route table
- Route tables can be created / assigned per subnet
- IP forwarding needs to be enabled on the NIC and within the OS to allow the device receiving traffic that is sent to a different IP 
- Forced tunnel: Go through VPN tunnel instead of going directly to the internet
  - Frontend still can route directly to the internet, but mid-tier and backend should be routed through OnPrem for increased security
  - Can be configured for an existing local network gateway
  - Configuration options:
    - BGP: VPN Gateway with BGP -> advertise 0.0.0.0/0 via BGP from OnPrem to Azure
    - Default Site: Can be configured in VPN gateway settings, OnPrem device needs to use 0.0.0.0/0 as traffic selectors
    - User-defined routes: To enable forced tunneling only for specific subnets
- Route Server:
  - Prefer either ER / VPN / ASPath (shortest BGP AS Path)
  - Needs to be deployed in its own subnet
  - Requires public IP
  - Routing information can be exchanged dynamically between azure networks (use routes automatically in ER / VPN Gateways instead of configuring manually) and onprem
    - Routes are automatically configured once advertised via BGP
- Debug:
  - NSG rules are visible in VM settings
  - Effective NSG rules and effective routes are visible in NIC settings with next hop type / IP
  - In network watcher using next hop diagnostic tool

# Load Balancing

  - Config:
    - DNS name with suffix trafficmanager.net (CNAME can be used)
    - Routing methods: Performance, Weighted (% based), Priority (All traffic to one location as long as available), Geographic (based on DNS query location - e.g. for compliance reasons regarding data sovereignity), MultiValue (Return all IPs for a given DNS), Subnet (CIDR)
  - Possible endpoints: Azure (either choose service or public ip), External, Nested (another traffic manager (e.g. first geographic, then performance))
  - Traffic manager monitoring settings for different endspoints requires nested traffic manager setup

## Azure Front Door
