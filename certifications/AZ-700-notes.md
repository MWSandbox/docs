# AZ 700

- 5 IP addresses of every subnet are reserved: the first 4 + the last one
- Public IP prefixes:
  - Pull from predictable list of public IP addresses
  - Choose up to 16 addresses to be reserved that will be next to each other
  - Advantages: Whitelisting, faster creation
- VMs can communicate between subnets on the same VNET if there is no additional NSG setup

# VMs
- VMs can be attached to multiple private and public IP addresses
- Inbound ports can be specified for VMs -> will generate NSG automatically
- Availability set: Logical groupings to reduce chance of correlated failures by assigning different fault domains
- DNS servers can be configured in NIC settings

# VPN
- Site-to-Site VPN:
  - Via IPsec Tunnel -> connects 2 public IP addresses on each side
  - Network gateways on each side (VPN gateway on Azure side)
  - Gateway Subnet (specific subnet) needs to be created
  - Service: Virtual network gateway (VPN device, handles also encryption/decryption)
    - Configuration
      - VPN types in Azure
        - Route-based: Route tables define where to send packets to, the tunnels themselves allow all traffic
        - Policy-based: Each VPN tunnel defines a policy of which traffic to permit
      - SKUs:
        - Basic: 10 Tunnels, no P2S OpenVPN Connections, less bandwidth, legacy SKU
        - VpnGw1-5: More tunnels, more P2S connection, more bandwidth
      - Generation:
        - 1: Less P2S connections
        - 2: More P2S connections
      - Active-active mode: 2 connections in parallel for failover
      - BGP protocol support for route-based VPNs - e.g. for Hub and Spoke models
    - Connections can bbe added with Local network gateway as target to establish VPN connection
      - Shared key (PSK) is required on each side, wwill be exchanged by IKE protocol
      - Types: VNet-to-VNet, Site-to-Site (IPsec), ExpressRoute
  - Virtual WAN should be used if you need more than 30 S2S connections
  - Local Network Gateway:
    - Representation of OnPrem gateway (pointing to OnPrem VPN gateway)
    - Configuration:
      - Endpoint: IP or FQDN
      - Define address space of Onprem network that does not overlap with Azure network
      - BGP support
- Extended networks for azure:
  - Extend Azure network with onprem network (e.g. Server cannot be moved to the cloud)
  - Alternatives should always be preferred (e.g. move server to Azure)
  - Using VXLAN tunnel between 2 Windows Server 2019 (2022 for the one in Azure) VMs that are capable of running nested virtualization
  - In Windows Admin center, there is an extension for extended networks
  - After tunnel has been established, IP addresses need to be defined that shall be extended into Azure
- Point-2-Site VPN:
  - Individuals connecting to Azure
  - A root certificate needs to be created, each client needs a certificate to connect, signed by the root cert
  - Configuration:
    - Address pool assigned to clients dynamically 
    - Root certificate public data
    - Revoked client certificates
  - VPN Client can be downloaded from Azure directly to start a connection from client side
  - Certificates public/private keys can be exported on Windows using certmgr
  - Export client cert in pfx format with private key
- Tunnel types:
  - OpenVPN
  - SSTP
  - IKEv2 (alone, with OpenVPn or with SSTP)
- Authentication types:
  - Azure certificate
  - RADIUS auth.: Required RADIUS server, can be used onprem AD and SSO
  - Azure AD

# ExpressRoute
- Onprem network connected to network provider edge location with dedicated line
- network provider has a primary/secondary dedicated connection to microsoft edge network
- Pricing based on bandwidth
- Inbound data transfer is free, unlimited data plan is available
- SKUs:
  - ER Premium to connect to all regions, otherwise only a single region
  - Standard: Connect to all regions within one geography (e.g. West Europe + France Central)
  - Local SKU: Only one Azure region in the same metro, no extra egress data transfer fee
- Global Reach: Multiple ExpressRoute connections can be connected (WAN)
- ER Direct: No network provider required, network will be connected directly with Azure network, Ã¼hysical isolation (higher security)
- Configuration via Virtual Network Gateway
  - SKUs:
    - Standard: Does not support ER + VPN together and lesss circuit connections
    - High Performance: VPN + ER
    - Ultra: Fast path, highest bandwidth
  - Can be deployed in 1-3 AZs (increased pricing)
  - Requires public IP

# Security
- Firewall vs WAF on Application Gateway:
  - WAF only filters incoming HTTPS traffic, handles Cross Site Scripting, etc.
  - Firewall also outgoing and non HTTPS traffic, more logic
  - Route table needs to be configured to route traffic through the firewall subnet - can also be setup the same way for App gateway
  - if both are configured: route inbound traffic through app gateway subnet and outbound traffic through firewall subnet
  - Azure Firewall requires its own dedicated subnet

## Azure Firewall
- Microsoft Threat Intelligence: Knows malicious IPs and FQDNs
- Needs to be placed in its own subnet which needs to be called "AzureFirewallSubnet"
- Tiers:
  - Standard
  - Premium: 
    - TLS inspection (TLS termination / 2 separate TLS connections from source to target)
    - URL filtering
    - IDPS (intrusion detection and prevention system, check byte sequencey in network traffic, etc.)
    - Web categories: Categorizes URLS using the complete URL not only FQDN (standard) - e.g.: google.com/news -> News
- Firewall management:
  - via firewall policies
    - Policiy config:
      - Can be added via collections or single rules
      - Priorities will be used
      - Allow/Deny
      - Define Source and Destination (IP/FQDN) as well as ports
      - Rule groups to collect rules / rule collections
    - Types:
      - Parent policy: Inheritance of rules
      - Rule collections: Set of rules with same priorities and action
      - DNAT rules: TCP/UDP protocols + ports + translated address and port
        - E.g. use public ip of firewall and RDP port -> forward it to private VM + RDP port
      - Network rules: TCP/UDP/ICMP/Any + ports
        - Can be used to Allow DNS lookup (UDP port 53) and add IP addresses of DNS servers
      - Application rules: http/https/etc. protocols + ports
  - via firewall rules (classic)
- Requires public IP
- Traffic needs to be routed through the firewall network (use private IP address of firewall)
- Firewall manager:
  - Allows management of firewall policies across network
  - Types of networks that can be secured that way: Virtual WAN, Hub + Spoke
  - Detect VNets / WAN that do not have firewall attached to it
  - Policies can be associated with other networks / hubs
## WAF
- Core rule set which protects against OWASP (supports different versions)
- Integrations to application gateway, front door, CDN
- WAF global policy with managed rules for OWASP
- Custom rules can be added and can override default rules:
  - Priority
  - Match Type (e.g. string)
  - Match Variable (e.g. RequestUri)
  - Operation (is / is not)
  - Operator (e.g. contains)
  - Transformations
  - Match Values
  - Action (Allow / deny)
## NSGs
- Default rules cannot be altered: 
  - Inbound: Allow within Vnet traffic, load balancer traffic and deny everything else
  - Outound: Allow towards Vnet, Internet, deny anything else (other private IPs)
- Can be attached to NICs or subnets
- Applications (https, etc.) and protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP) configurable
- Source / targets: IPs / Service Tags / Application Security Group
- Service Tags: Internet, etc. -> A group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service
- Application security group: Group together resources with the samen security / network requirements

# Service endpoints
- Need to be setup on the subnet side and on the service side that should be connected
- Better performance and latency compared to public / Azure managed network
- Increased security

# DNS
- Azure DNS Private Resolver
  - Azure private DNS records can be used OnPrem
  - Provides DNS services between On-Prem and Azure
  - Conditional forwarding -> e.g. if internet needs to be resolved, the Azure DNS Private Resolver can forward those requests to an internet DNS server
  - Inbound (from on prem to azure)/output (from azure to on prem) endpoints, latter will be forwarded to onprem DNS
- Public DNS zone
  - You can register any domain name -> Multiple Name servers of azure will be displayed
  - Azure name servers need to be configured in a domain name registrar
- Records:
  - A = Point to IPv4 address
  - CNAME = Link subdomain to another record
  - NS = Authorative name server for that domain
  - SOA = Start of Authority - stores metadata like the email address of the admin
  - Use @ sign in DNS record to refer to the standard domain name without subdomain
- Private DNS Zone:
  - No NS record
  - Needs to be linked to VNETs
  - Auto registration can be enabled -> All VMs will automatically receive a nicename

# Connecting VNETs
- VNET peering
  - Types:
    - Standard: Within the same region
    - Global: Across Azure regions
  - Traffic over Microsoft backbone network, not public internet
  - Pricing for outbount and inbound traffic even for standard VNET peering (charged twice)
  - IP ranges should not be overlapping
  - Configuration:
    - Block traffic from one direction to the other
    - Allow forwarding of traffic from one direction to the other
    - Virtual network gateway or Route server can be configured
  - Sensitive data should be encrypted -> Use network gateway
- VPN Gateway
  - Traffic over public Internet via IPSec tunnel
  - Slower, different pricing (inbound is free)
- Network gateway

# WAN
- Hub & Spoke:
  - All network connect to one hub, instead of connecting all networks to each other
- Virtual WAN:
  - Types:
    - Basic: Only VPN S2S
    - Standard: ExpressrRoute, all VPN options, VNET-to-VNET, etc.
  - Pricing:
    - Per hour, per GB of use, bandwidth dependent, per connection
  - Hub:
    - Has its own network private address space
    - Can create gatewways for VPN S2S/P2S and ExpressRoute
    - Options for traffic to tracel accross Microsoft network as long as possible before it enters public internet
  - VPN Sites:
    - Similar to local network gateway for the Virtual WAN
    - Links can be added for the actual VPN Gateway OnPrem: IP address, BPG address, ASN number, Link speed etc. need to be entered
    - After creating the link, the site needs to be connected:
      - Pre-shared key can be entered, protocol and routing options can be selected
  - Virtual network connections:
    - VNETs can be selected and route table assigned

# Routing
- System routes: Default set of routes
  - Routing within the VNET
  - 0.0.0.0/0 -> Internet
- VNet ppering, Virtual network gateway, Service Endpoints -> Will add routes to the system route table
- Route tables can be created / assigned per subnet
- IP forwarding needs to be enabled on the NIC and within the OS to allow the device receiving traffic that is sent to a different IP 
- Forced tunnel: Go through VPN tunnel instead of going directly to the internet
  - Frontend still can route directly to the internet, but mid-tier and backend should be routed through OnPrem for increased security

# Load Balancing

![Decision tree](./resources/load-balancing-decision-tree.png)

## Load Balancer
- Basic tier is free
  - Up to 300 instances
  - VMs in a single availability set or a VMSS

- Standard tier:
  - Up to 1.000 instances
  - Any VM, any VMSS in a single VNet
  - HTTPS health probe, multi AZ, high availability (for internal LB), 99,99% SLA supported
  - NSG is required
- Public vs. internal/private LBs
- Layer 4 (transport)
- High availability through global load balancer that can balance regional LBs
- Multiple IPs can be connected to the same LB
- Health probes need to be added manually:

- Only supports balancing traffic inside a single VNet
- Load balancing rules:
  - Specify protocol, port and FE IP
  - Port can be changed while routing
  - Session persistence can be set (always route to the same server within the same session), idle timeout for sessions can be set
  - Floating IP: To reach the same port on the same VM multiple times (requires multiple NICs)
- Good use case in front of IaaS (VMs)

## Application Gateway

  - Supports other services in addition to azure VMs (compared to Load Balancer): App Services, IP addresses, FQDNs
  - Routing rules:
    - HTTP/HTTPS traffic only
    - Multi-site to register more web applications on the same port (e.g. with different FQDNs)
    - Cookie-based affinity to root based on cookies to the same target server
    - Connection draining: When server gets shutdown, wait until there is no more traffic 
    - Backend paths and host names can be overriden
